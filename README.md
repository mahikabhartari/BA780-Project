  The objective of our project is to study the the trends in film industry, factors effecting the revenue and hence popularity of the movies in the dataset, study the relations between the genres and the keywords used to describe various movies belonging to different genres.
With the rise of available film content, it is crucial to investigate and assess patterns in the film industry revolving around runtime, revenues, movie genres, and factors correlated with them. These elements allow for the discovery of how films have been changing and what consumers have preferred for the last century. Because the amount of films on the market is rising and competition is rising with it, the film industry can benefit from such insights by identifying what factors have led to films' success.
Along with this, our team is collectively passionate about the film industry and was excited to investigate patterns and make inferences from the dataset used.
